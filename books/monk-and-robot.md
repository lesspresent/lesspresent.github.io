A meditative two-part series.
Becky Chamber's writing paints vivid imagery, and the world she's built is a solarpunk utopia.
I would have enjoyed a few more hours with the main characters, Dex and Mosscap, as they explore the human condition.
There's very little tension in the books, which makes them a perfect read when your mind feels tumultuous.
