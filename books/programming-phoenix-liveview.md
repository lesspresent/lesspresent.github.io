This book goes into the perfect amount of detail for me.
It answers questions like: "How does LiveView actually work?", "What magic is happening in the background?", and "What's the idiomatic way to do this?"
The general flow of the book matches my style, as well -- read, implement, then explore your implementation's dependencies in depth.

There are some errors in the code samples and typographical mistakes; however, this is a beta book.

It helps that I seem to enjoy writing Elixir.
The documentation is unparalleled, the tooling is great, and it feels very productive.
