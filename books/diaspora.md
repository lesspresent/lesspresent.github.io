[Notes: Rough. In place notes and editing of thoughts.]

I love it so far; great hard sci-fi.
Every sub-chapter separator leaves space to explore the people, technology, societies, and places described.
Egan's writing is vivid, with realism, depth, and great use of imagery.
It seems like one of those books that generates Wikipedia tabs -- the book provides glances at interesting topics.

There are a couple of topics that popped out at me.
Diaspora's first chapter observes a new mind being formed, then born, inside of a simulation; great imagery.
Differences in experienced time are explored, as are hints at the question of continuity in consciousness.
There are differing philosophies among the three major societies (and some of their subgroups).
Liguistics, and intercultural communication are touched.
There's a bit on laser interferometry (on a big scale!), and some discussion on pulsars and gamma ray bursts.
And a set of visual excercises in topology.
