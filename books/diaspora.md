[Notes: Rough. In place notes and editing of thoughts.]

## Overview
I love it so far; great hard sci-fi.
Every sub-chapter separator is an invitation to explore the people, technology, societies, and places described.
Egan's writing is vivid, with realism, depth, and imagery.

There are three societies comprising different descendents of humans, with their own subgroups.

There are gleisner robots. Simulated beings living in robotic bodies. They live in space, move asteroids, and observe deep space.

There are polises of citizens, simulated beings living together in supercomputers (some of which are underground, while others are in orbit). Polises have different philosophies and cultural identities. Konishi is where the main character is from -- an abstract, non-physical society that seems to value science. Other polises are visited or discussed.

There are fleshers, biological humans living on the earth's surface. Among the fleshers there are those who don't have genetic modifications (statics) and those who have modifications from minor (improvements to digestion) to extreme (bird people).
There's a lot of mistrust toward the polises and gleisners among the fleshers, to a varying degree.

# Topics noted
Diaspora's first chapter observes a new mind being formed, then born, inside of a simulation -- nice detail, surprisingly engaging.
Differences in experienced time are explored, as are hints at the question of continuity in consciousness.
There are differing philosophies among the three major societies (and some of their subgroups).
Liguistics, and intercultural communication are touched.
There's a bit on laser interferometry (on a big scale!), and some discussion on pulsars and gamma ray bursts.
And a set of visual excercises in topology.
