Fantastic, guided tour of implementing a language.
I've tried a few of the exercises before reading them and have been pleasently surprised that: 1) Some of my approaches match the author's, and 2) Some of them don't, and the author has thought of quite a few thing I haven't.
A good mix of "challenging enough" and "brand new concepts".
Other books have taken a front-seat, for now, but I plan to come back to this one.
