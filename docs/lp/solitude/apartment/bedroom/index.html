        <p>Sunset walls reflect ambient light.
A rising stream of incense is disturbed by a hidden circulating fan, clearly tuned to generate relaxing pink noise.</p>
<p>The carpet is crimson, it's sole occupants a central meditation pillow and several large plants.
Inset into a cubby in the north wall is a bed, spacious but not quite tall enough to stand upright.
Drawers and a wardrobe are built into the east wall, evidenced only by their outlines and flush-mounted handles.</p>
<p>On the east wall, near the southern corner, there is an open doorway leading to the <a href="../bathroom">bathroom</a>.</p>
<p>There is a sliding pocket door along the west wall that opens to the <a href="../lounge">lounge</a>.</p>
