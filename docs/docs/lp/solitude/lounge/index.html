        </div>
        <p>Burning cherrywood unfurls ribbons of scent throughout the air.</p>
<p>Flickering yellows from the fireplace are overwhelmed by a deep, penetrating orange bathing the room.
The ceiling and north wall are one continuous pane of curved glass -- an expansive,
electrochromatically tinted window through which a red dwarf star dominates the view.
Overlaid on the <a href="../lounge_window">glass</a> are neatly organized informational text describing the star's stellar characteristics.</p>
<p>Composite panels comprise the floor, though the room's western section has a large bearskin
rug around and upon which sit a chaise lounge, leather armchair, and small coffee table.
Beyond the furniture is stone-mantled fireplace, fully ablaze.</p>
<p>Along the eastern wall are a bar toward the northern end and a pocket door to the <a href="../bedroom">bedroom</a> near the southern end.
Behind the bar are an espresso machine, a single beer tap, and three bottles.
There's also an empty shelf, inset in the wall and lit from within.</p>
<p>In the center of the southern wall are a set of doors to the <a href="../study">study</a>.</p>
