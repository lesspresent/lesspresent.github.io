        </div>
        <p>Wood slat walls, low-pile carpet, and indirect lighting form a cylindrical room, 12 meters in diameter.
A borderless glass ceiling, five meters above, reveals starscapes unobscured by atmosphere.
The air is highly filtered and of low humidity.</p>
<p>Inset bookshelves trace the quarter circumferences along the east, south, and west sections of the room.
Standing two meters high, they hold thousands of volumes varying in color, shape, age, and ornamentation.
Sculptures, models and paintings appear among the books.</p>
<p>A large, semi-circular <a href="/">desk</a> occupies the room's center.
On it are papers, a large display, keyboard and mouse, and a beaker full office supplies -- pens, pencils, polymer eraser, highlighter, aluminum ruler.
Behind the desk is an ergonomic chair, fully reclined to observe the stars.</p>
<p>Along the northern section of the room is a set of <a href="../lounge">handleless double-doors</a>.</p>
