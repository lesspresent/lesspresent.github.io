        <p>I'll start by saying: Awesome book, hard sci-fi at its best.
Diaspora is an exploration of physics, cosmology, simulated realities, an alternate dimensions with enough depth and realism to feel possible.</p>
<p>It has a slow, enjoyable start.
Egan describes the process of forming a new mind inside of a Polis -- a supercomputer full of citizens.
The new mind learns by doing, with even basic sensory tasks a brand new experience, and Egan brings us along for the ride.
He does a remarkable job putting you in that headspace.</p>
<p>There are a few chapters of ups-and-downs before the book really picks about 2/3rds of the way through.
Concepts and utterly alien ideas are thrown at you, with mid-chapter breaks providing the space necessary to reflect and absorb all that's been written.
You are asked to leave this universe and enter a five dimensional space, then another space, then another.
You are asked to imagine a chain of clones, each a tiny-bit closer to a lifeform too different to communicate with -- a living bridge allowing an original to commune with a totally different type of life.
You are asked to imagine what it's like to clone your mind thousands of times, and send the clones immeasurably far -- quite literally, in time, and distance -- from one another.</p>
<p>The pace in the books final 10th is unimaginably fast until it suddenly stops.
At that moment, looking in the rearview mirror, you feel what the characters feel, as though you've seen what you needed to see without realizing it at all.
It's as close to an adreneline rush as I can imagine a book generating.</p>
