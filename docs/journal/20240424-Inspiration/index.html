        <p>Aside from the technology hurdles of writing text adventures, which I talked about in the last post, it's tough to write in a descriptive and engaging way.
How do you write prose that's rich and inviting?
To get inspiration, I've been trying to read more fiction (especially sci-fi). I've also been jotting-down descriptions of the scenes I notice while walking or watching videos.</p>
<p>Some of the better Sci-Fi I've recently read includes Monk and Robot by Becky Chambers and Diaspora by Greg Egan.
I'm trying to take note of how I feel about the level of detail, which descriptions capture my attention, and where my focus wanders.
What are the scenes that really let me play a movie in my mind, and how are those written?</p>
<p>And, so, I'm practicing this style amalgamation and hoping I learn a bit more about my own style!
We'll see... :)</p>
