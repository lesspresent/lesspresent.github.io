Thousands of rainshower nozzles form a 3 meter by 3 meter grid in the center of the ceiling.
A triangular column emerges from the floor at the southeastern corner of the grid, reaching chest-height.
It has a soap-shelf, as well as shower controls mounted on the column's 45-degree cut top.

Near the southwestern corner of the room is a small watercloset.
There's a sink and mirror on the northern wall, and towel racks along the eastern wall.

A small robot is deep-cleaning the surfaces.

Eucalyptus and lavendar hang in the warm, humid air.

Along the west wall is a doorway to the [bedroom](../bedroom).
