Deep blue tones bathe the room, shifting and morphing like slow-motion reflections on the bottom of a swimming pool.

The ceiling and north wall are a continuous pane of curved glass -- an expansive,
electrochromatically tinted window through which a massive blue star dominates the view.
Through the bottom quarter of the window, the planet's rocky hills are featureless silhouettes, barely containing the starlight behind them.
Overlaid on the [glass](../lounge_window), neatly organized informational text describes the star's stellar characteristics.

Composite panels comprise the floor, though the room's western section has a large bearskin
rug around and upon which sit a chaise lounge, leather armchair, and small coffee table.
Left of the sitting area is a pocket door to the [local transit station](../transit).

Along the eastern wall are a bar toward the northern end and a pocket door to the [bedroom](../bedroom) near the southern end.
Behind the bar are an espresso machine, a single beer tap, and three bottles.
There's also an empty shelf, inset in the wall and lit from within.

In the center of the southern wall are a set of doors to the [study](../study).
