Burning cherrywood unfurls ribbons of scent throughout the air.

Flickering yellows from the fireplace are overwhelmed by a deep, penetrating orange bathing the room.
The ceiling and north wall are one continuous pane of curved glass -- an expansive,
electrochromatically tinted window through which a red dwarf star dominates the view.
Overlaid on the [glass](../lounge_window) are neatly organized informational text describing the star's stellar characteristics.

Composite panels comprise the floor, though the room's western section has a large bearskin
rug around and upon which sit a chaise lounge, leather armchair, and small coffee table.
Beyond the furniture is stone-mantled fireplace, fully ablaze.

Along the eastern wall are a bar toward the northern end and a pocket door to the [bedroom](../bedroom) near the southern end.
Behind the bar are an espresso machine, a single beer tap, and three bottles.
There's also an empty shelf, inset in the wall and lit from within.

In the center of the southern wall are a set of doors to the [study](../study).
